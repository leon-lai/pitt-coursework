For this assignment I did a Business Component. It is an unconventional online shopping cart that tries to model physical shopping experience. Unlike in normal online shopping sites, where users are presented with models to choose from, my website presents all the individual items in inventory to grab, much like seeing all the vegetables on the vegetable shelves while in a grocery store.
