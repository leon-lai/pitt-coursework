	<title>Filter Studio Front-end</title>
	<desc>
		SVG filters are a pretty neat feature. I had used a Chrome extension
		called High Contrast (djcfdncoelnlbldjfhinnjlhdjlikmph) to invert the
		colors of pages with dark text on light background so that they are not
		so bright and uncomfortable to my eyes. It inverted the colors of images
		as well, which puzzled me as to how it did that with presumably CSS
		injection or what JavaScript library it used. It was only last month
		that I found out that this extension actually injects SVG filters to
		accomplish all the color modifications. Before then I did not know that
		one could declare image filters in webpages or even that modern web
		browsers have these functions. Given this assignment to build a dynamic
		and interactive webpage, I wanted to make a tool with which I could play
		around with this newfound feature in web design standards.
		------------------------------------------------------------------------
		This intellidoc lets users specify a base image and add SVG filter
		primitives to construct an SVG filter to operate on that image. Users
		can create, delete, and alter filter primitives.
		------------------------------------------------------------------------
		This SVG document serves as the front-end of Filter Studio. It contains
		a filter element and a foreignObject element containing XHTML. The
		filter element is where filter primitives reside, and the XHTML elements
		are where groups of controls to configure the filter primitives reside.
		This front-end is styled with CSS, by the corresponding CSS file. The
		back-end is described and implemented in the corresponding JavaScript
		file.
